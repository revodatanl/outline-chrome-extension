# Outline Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that allows you to easily clip and save web content to your Outline wiki. This extension helps you capture and organize web content with just a few clicks, maintaining the original formatting and automatically organizing clips by domain.

## Features

- 🎯 **Quick Clipping**: Select text and right-click to send it directly to your Outline wiki
- 📝 **Markdown Conversion**: Automatically converts web content to clean Markdown format
- 📂 **Smart Organization**: Automatically creates and manages folders by domain
- 📊 **Metadata Preservation**: Captures important metadata like source URL, author, and publication date
- 🎨 **Clean Interface**: Minimal, Apple-style design with smooth animations
- 🔒 **Secure**: Uses API tokens for authentication and secure communication
- ⚡ **Fast & Reliable**: Built with performance and reliability in mind

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory

## Configuration

1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Enter your Outline instance URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
3. Add your API token (can be generated in Outline settings)
4. Click "Save" and "Check Connection" to verify everything works

### Databricks Apps

Databricks Apps consumes `Authorization`. This fork sends the Outline API key in the JSON body as `token` and as `X-Outline-Token`, and uses `credentials: "include"` so the Databricks browser session can pass the Apps proxy. Stay signed in to Databricks in the same browser. Do not put the Outline key in `Authorization`.

## Usage

1. Select text on any webpage
2. Right-click and select "Send to Outline"
3. The content will be saved to your Outline wiki in a domain-specific folder
4. Click the notification to open the newly created document
